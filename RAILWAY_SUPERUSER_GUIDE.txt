# In Railway, go to your project and add this as a ONE-TIME DEPLOYMENT command
# Settings -> Deploy -> Add "Run After Deploy" command:
# python create_superuser.py

# OR manually trigger via Railway's web-based console

# SIMPLIFIED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER:
# Since Railway CLI runs locally, you need to use Railway's web interface:

# Option 1: Use Railway's Web Console
# 1. Go to Railway dashboard
# 2. Click your service
# 3. Look for "Console" or "Shell" tab (may be under three dots menu)
# 4. Type: python create_superuser.py
# 5. Press Enter

# Option 2: Temporarily modify Procfile to run on startup
# Add this line to Procfile BEFORE gunicorn:
# web: sh -c "python create_superuser.py || true && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input && gunicorn portfolio_site.wsgi --log-file -"

# The || true ensures it continues even if user already exists
